* Creating an open source push server
* Further developing the Ownpush android service / client
* Creating new OwnPush clients for more platforms (for example windows / javascript)
* Further developing the OwnPush onbaording process for developers


## Background

OwnPush is an open source targeted push messaging system, currently only partially open source and is in
need of extra developent to make it a fully open source tool for the entire mobile community. The majority

to create a more open source friendly service for the entire developement community to make use of. Some
example outcomes would be.


1. Published an open source OwnPush server based on the exsisting documentation / examples
2. Upgreaded the currend OwnPush development process to help developers make use of the service
3. Publish an enhanced version of the OwnPush android service.
4. Publish a new  OwnPush client for a new operating system / platform
