## IDEA

Make a (free) git client for Android that will ideally allow people to:
* do all basic git operations (clone to your device, stage, commit, pull, push, etc.) 
* create files, write code and use basic operations on them
* revert changes easily
* merge and delete branches
* view a graphical log of commits
* view your Github or Bitbucket contributions (number of contributions, pulse, etc)
* have a git bash built in the app
* any extra features the mentors would like to add.


##Background

The current git clients available on Play Store are not upto the mark or updated and have several problems. All shortcomings will be addressed in the app.


##Expected Results

Make a truly seamless git client that works perfectly with no issues across devices. It should be expected to pull changes directly when you open the app and the main focus (atleast on mobile devices, if not tablet) will be on viewing what the changes are. Emphasis will be made on code editing and viewing on tablets.
