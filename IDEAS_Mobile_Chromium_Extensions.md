# Idea: Mobile Chromium Extensions

## Background

The desktop version of Chrome comes with the possibility to add custom extensions that add new features to the 
browser and allow to further customize it. The mobile version lacks this feature, so that important security and
privacy plugins as well as customization options are not available in mobile Chrome browser.

The Chrome browser on both platforms is based on a mostly equal codebase from the Chromium project. The source code
for the mobile Chrome was added in 2015. The Goal of this project is to port the extension capability of the 
desktop Chromium to its mobile pendant.

## Expected Results

A fork of Mobile Chromium, that has support for extensions, including:

- UI to configure, (en/dis)able and uninstall extensions, as well as adding them from the sdcard.
- Make extensions accessible from overflow menu, allow to open extension settings pages as tabs.
- Possibility to use and install desktop Chrome extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

It is not expected for the changes to be accepted upstream, but the code should still match coding style guidelines
of the Chromium project.
