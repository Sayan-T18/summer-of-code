# IDEA: Computer Vision

The project is aimed to provide description of surroundings through the camera on a mobile phone.
The smartphone camera will analyse the objects possibly through openCV library and tell the results through speech library.

## Description
The project is aimed primarily so that the blind people can experience how their surrounding looks like. We can make use of hand gesture recognition so as to recognise an object or to train the application.

## Expected outcome
A handy tool for the blind persons so that they can know their surrounding, though its application can be extended to other areas as well like teaching a child for day to day objects. In the end we would have developed an efficient means to analyse different objects.
